                <hr>
                <p>In my Business Fraternity I further involved myself as an Assistant Treasurer, Brotherhood Chair, and Judicial Board member. This has provided me with valuable experiences in leadership, teamwork, and accountability.

In my role as Brotherhood Chair, I facilitated team-building activities to promote a strong sense of community. As a member of the Judicial Board, I learned how to handle conflicts and make fair decisions. I have also tutored younger students in Python and C++. This helped me develop my teaching and communication skills while furthering my understanding on the topics. Through these experiences, I have gained a well-rounded skill set that will serve me well in any future endeavors.</p>
